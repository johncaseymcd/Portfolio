          </h1>
          <p class="intro-text">
            Hey there, my name is John McDonough, but please call me Nick!
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            I am currently <span id="age"></span> years old and located in the
            Inland Empire region of Southern California, but I was born and
            raiesd in and around Indianapolis, IN. My interest in tech started
            from an early age as I grew up watching the world adapt to the
            Internet and the various phenomena that came with it. From chain
            emails to flash games to social media, I always wanted to learn more
            about how the machines actually worked. When I got my first desktop
            PC at age 11, I learned how to take it apart, identify the
            components and their functions, and make modifications and upgrades.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            However, it wasn't until high school that I took an interest in
            programming. I enrolled in a course that covered basic concepts and
            logic using QBASIC, then taught us to apply those in an
            obect-oriented context using C++. I discovered that I liked coding,
            so the following year, I signed up for AP Java Programming and...
            failed. Discouraged, I decided to remove Computer Science from my
            list of potential college majors and go with Economics instead.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            While in college, I took a few beginner courses in the school of
            Comp. Sci. - web design, databases, and UX/UI - but nothing really
            stuck until a couple years after school, when I learned of a coding
            bootcamp that was offering free tuition due to the COVID-19
            pandemic. I had nothing to lose, so I signed up for their Software
            Development course in C&#35;. It was during that course that the
            concepts really clicked for me, and shortly after graduation I began
            working for the bootcamp as an instructor assistant before landing
            my first official developer role with a local startup.
          </p>

            <p class="img-description">
              The CSS Creature was a challenge to design a face using only CSS
              to style HTML &lt;div&gt; tags. I created a triangular creature
              loosely based on Katy Kat from Parappa The Rapper and Frylock from
              Aqua Teen Hunger Force, using an outrun/synthwave aesthetic, which
              is one of my favorite color palettes &lpar;if you couldn&apos;t
              tell&rpar;.

            <p class="img-description">
              Looking back on this project now, and even in the thumbnail for
              this gallery entry, I see how little I knew about responsive
              design when I was first starting out. The face is off-center on
              the circle, and completely outside of the cirle on screens that
              are larger or smaller than 1920x1080 - the resolution of the
              monitor I was using at the time. Now that I have done more
              full-stack projects, I have learned the beauty of Bootstrap and
              mobile-first design patterns for front-end work.

            /></a>
            <p class="img-description">
              The static store front project was an exercise in HTML and CSS.
              For this project, I created a mockup of a record store website,
              featuring sections for new music releases, nearby concerts, and a
              Spotify &lt;iframe&gt; to showcase recent listening.
            </p>
            <p class="img-description">
              While I think the site turned out pretty well for just being raw
              HTML &amp; CSS, this project also lacks the fundamentals of
              responsive design. Again, it looks okay on a 1920x1080 screen, but
              elements become shifted around and end up in weird places on any
              screens outside that resolution. This one could easily be cleaned
              up with some Bootstrap work - which is the layout style I was
              trying to copy before I even knew what Bootstrap was!

              This group API project was my first experience coding in a team
              environment. Working collaboratively was awesome, since I got to
              see how other people write their code and how different minds can
              come up with different solutions to the same problem. Our group
              was very supportive and helpful to each other throughout the
              project, and even when the GitHub branches got wonky just a few
              days before the due date, and the only working copy was on one of
              our local machines, we kept our cool. We worked together to
              resolve the Git issues and were able to turn in a fully functional
              project that met many of its stretch goals.
            </p>
            <p class="img-description">
              I'm still proud of this project, and I'm definitely grateful for
              the Git lessons it taught me. Working on a team of devs is a much
              different experience than just coding by oneself, and figuring out
              how to integrate 3 separate styles and files into a cohesive
              codebase was incredibly satisfying.

              The final boss of Eleven Fifty - the individual MVC application.
              The challenge was to build a fully fleshed-out back end and
              customized front end using the MVC structure. I chose to build a
              repository for video games, with information about the developer,
              the platform, release date, genre, ESRB rating, and more. All
              columns in the list views are fully linked to view other lists
              filtered by the respective column, and the detail views for each
              game, developer, and platform are fully linked as well. One of my
              stretch goals was to implement user-specific collections - for
              games the user has played, games they own, and games they want to
              own - but while attempting to implement the functionality I
              realized I was in over my head and was lost in a sea of debugging
              just 4 days before the due date. Thus, the finished product linked
              here is the result of 1 day of back-end coding, 1 day of back-end
              debugging, and 1 day of Razor/CSS front-end implementation.
            </p>
            <p class="img-description">
              Once again, due to the rush of trying to rewrite the whole
              project, I did not have the time to implement the Bootstrap
              functionality that would have made the site so much cleaner and
              more professional-looking. When I entered into the &quot;Software
              Development&quot; program, I was not expecting to work with
              anything front-end at all; in fact, I was averse to learning it
              because I wanted to perfect the back-end first. Now having worked
              in a full-stack role, I wish that I would have learned basic
              front-end functionality much sooner than I did. Such is life!
