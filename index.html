            ABOUT ME
          </h1>
          <p class="intro-text">
            Hey there, my name is John McDonough, but please call me Nick!
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            I am currently <span id="age"></span> years old and located in the
            Inland Empire region of Southern California, but I was born and
            raiesd in and around Indianapolis, IN. My interest in tech started
            from an early age as I grew up watching the world adapt to the
            Internet and the various phenomena that came with it. From chain
            emails to flash games to social media, I always wanted to learn more
            about how the machines actually worked. When I got my first desktop
            PC at age 11, I learned how to take it apart, identify the
            components and their functions, and make modifications and upgrades.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            However, it wasn't until high school that I took an interest in
            programming. I enrolled in a course that covered basic concepts and
            logic using QBASIC, then taught us to apply those in an
            obect-oriented context using C++. I discovered that I liked coding,
            so the following year, I signed up for AP Java Programming and...
            failed. Discouraged, I decided to remove Computer Science from my
            list of potential college majors and go with Economics instead.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            While in college, I took a few beginner courses in the school of
            Comp. Sci. - web design, databases, and UX/UI - but nothing really
            stuck until a couple years after school, when I learned of a coding
            bootcamp that was offering free tuition due to the COVID-19
            pandemic. I had nothing to lose, so I signed up for their Software
            Development course in C&#35;. It was during that course that the
            concepts really clicked for me, and shortly after graduation I began
            working for the bootcamp as an instructor assistant before landing
            my first official developer role with a local startup.
          </p>

            When I am not coding, I am likely to be playing, producing, or

          /></a>
          <p class="img-description">
            The CSS Creature was a challenge to design a face using only CSS to
            style HTML &lt;div&gt; tags. I created a triangular creature loosely
            based on Katy Kat from Parappa The Rapper and Frylock from Aqua Teen
            Hunger Force, using an outrun/synthwave aesthetic, which is one of
            my favorite color palettes &lpar;if you couldn&apos;t tell&rpar;.
          </p>
          <p class="img-description">
            Looking back on this project now, and even in the thumbnail for this
            gallery entry, I see how little I knew about responsive design when
            I was first starting out. The face is off-center on the circle, and
            completely outside of the cirle on screens that are larger or
            smaller than 1920x1080 - the resolution of the monitor I was using
            at the time. Now that I have done more full-stack projects, I have
            learned the beauty of Bootstrap and mobile-first design patterns for
            front-end work.

              alt="A mockup of a storefront page for a record store, featuring three columns for events, new releases, and current playlists."
          /></a>
          <p class="img-description">
            The static store front project was an exercise in HTML and CSS. For
            this project, I created a mockup of a record store website,
            featuring sections for new music releases, nearby concerts, and a
            Spotify &lt;iframe&gt; to showcase recent listening.
          </p>
          <p class="img-description">
            While I think the site turned out pretty well for just being raw
            HTML &amp; CSS, this project also lacks the fundamentals of
            responsive design. Again, it looks okay on a 1920x1080 screen, but
            elements become shifted around and end up in weird places on any
            screens outside that resolution. This one could easily be cleaned up
            with some Bootstrap work - which is the layout style I was trying to
            copy before I even knew what Bootstrap was!

            This group API project was my first experience coding in a team
            environment. Working collaboratively was awesome, since I got to see
            how other people write their code and how different minds can come
            up with different solutions to the same problem. Our group was very
            supportive and helpful to each other throughout the project, and
            even when the GitHub branches got wonky just a few days before the
            due date, and the only working copy was on one of our local
            machines, we kept our cool. We worked together to resolve the Git
            issues and were able to turn in a fully functional project that met
            many of its stretch goals.

          <p class="img-description">
            I'm still proud of this project, and I'm definitely grateful for the
            Git lessons it taught me. Working on a team of devs is a much
            different experience than just coding by oneself, and figuring out
            how to integrate 3 separate styles and files into a cohesive
            codebase was incredibly satisfying.

            The final boss of Eleven Fifty - the individual MVC application. The
            challenge was to build a fully fleshed-out back end and customized
            front end using the MVC structure. I chose to build a repository for
            video games, with information about the developer, the platform,
            release date, genre, ESRB rating, and more. All columns in the list
            views are fully linked to view other lists filtered by the
            respective column, and the detail views for each game, developer,
            and platform are fully linked as well. One of my stretch goals was
            to implement user-specific collections - for games the user has
            played, games they own, and games they want to own - but while
            attempting to implement the functionality I realized I was in over
            my head and was lost in a sea of debugging just 4 days before the
            due date. Thus, the finished product linked here is the result of 1
            day of back-end coding, 1 day of back-end debugging, and 1 day of
            Razor/CSS front-end implementation.
          </p>
          <p class="img-description">
            Once again, due to the rush of trying to rewrite the whole project,
            I did not have the time to implement the Bootstrap functionality
            that would have made the site so much cleaner and more
            professional-looking. When I entered into the &quot;Software
            Development&quot; program, I was not expecting to work with anything
            front-end at all; in fact, I was averse to learning it because I
            wanted to perfect the back-end first. Now having worked in a
            full-stack role, I wish that I would have learned basic front-end
            functionality much sooner than I did. Such is life!

            This project is great because I have been experimenting with
            building out the site in different languages/frameworks. I started
            in ASP.NET Core, but wanted something a bit more lightweight so I
            changed over to Node.js/Express, which I was already relatively
            familiar with from my job.

            After doing some tinkering with Nx/React and Docker/Nginx, I have

            and admin experience with the site.
