          <p class="body-text">
            I'm 29 years old and I've been coding with a career in mind since
            October 2020, but I've wanted to be a programmer since I was 12. To
            that end, I took several classes in high school and college -
            covering languages like C++, Java, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JS.
            <br />
            My junior year of high school proved to be a major turning point in
            my career aspirations, however, as I failed out of my AP Java
            Programming course and took a huge blow to my confidence. Upon
            entering college, I decided to abandon my dreams and declare a major
            in Economics.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            After 6 years of college, I decided mid-semester in my senior
            capstone course that Econ really just wasn't my thing. I left school
            to go to work full time at a data entry position for a financial
            services company, but I quickly found myself wanting more. I took a
            promotion at that company to a client-facing role, but that wasn't
            fulfilling me either - and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            A coworker from that company had gone through a coding bootcamp to
            learn web development, and she mentioned that they were offering
            free tuition as part of the CARES Act, so with nothing to lose I
            decided to rekindle my interest in coding. I signed up for the
            software development course, where I learned the essentials of C#,
            specifically the ASP.NET Framework for building web APIs and MVC
            structures in a code-first model.
            <br />
            I fell in love with the logic, the processes, and the syntax, and
            everything finally clicked in a way that it hadn't when I was in
            high school. Shortly after I graduated from the bootcamp, I was
            brought on as an assistant instructor, responsible for helping
            students not only debug their code, but understand <i>how</i> to
            debug and <i>why</i> the solutions were correct. Knowledge without
            context is only useful for bar trivia, so it's important for me to
            figure out the reasoning behind an answer - and I loved being able
            to help other people reach those &quot;A-HA&quot; moments.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            As someone who has held jobs in a wide array of fields, ranging from
            food service to financial service, writing code for a living has
            been the most challenging yet rewarding experience of my working
            life, and I would love to keep doing it for years to come.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            Maybe I will spend those years working with you?
          </p>
        </div>

          <h1 class="section-header">The TL;DR</h1>

          <p class="body-text">
            I've been coding as a career path for over 2 years, starting off as
            a bootcamp student learning API and MVC architectures in the C#
            ASP.NET Framework. After graduating, I was hired as a part of the
            instructor staff at that bootcamp, helping students who were . From
            there, I moved to a small startup, where I learned how to build and
            deploy full stack web projects in an Amazon Web Services cloud
            environment, using Node.js.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            Prior to learning code, I was always interested in tech but never
            committed enough to make a living off of it, so I spent my working
            life in various positions, from food service and retail to mortgage
            and escrow. Nothing seemed to stick, so I eventually decided to do
            what I had actually wanted to do since I was in middle school, and
            now I have a vision for the future of my career.

          /></a>
          <p class="img-description">
            The CSS Creature was a challenge to design a face using only CSS to
            style HTML &lt;div&gt; tags. I created a triangular creature loosely
            based on Katy Kat from Parappa The Rapper and Frylock from Aqua Teen
            Hunger Force, using an outrun/synthwave aesthetic and color scheme
            (my favorite color palette, if you couldn't tell...)
          </p>
          <p class="img-description">
            Looking back on this project now, and even in the thumbnail for this
            gallery entry, I see how little I knew about responsive design when
            I was first starting out. The face is off-center on the circle, and
            completely outside of the cirle on screens that are larger/smaller
            than 1920x1080 - the resolution of the monitor I was using at the
            time. Now that I have done more full-stack projects, I have begun to
            see the beauty of Bootstrap and mobile-first design patterns for
            front-end work.

          /></a>
          <p class="img-description">
            The static store front project was an exercise in HTML and CSS. For
            this project, I created a mockup of a record store website,
            featuring sections for new music releases, nearby concerts, and a
            Spotify iframe to showcase recent listening.
          </p>
          <p class="img-description">
            While I think the site turned out pretty well for just being raw
            HTML &amp; CSS, this project also suffers from a lack of
            responsiveness. Again, it looks okay on a 1920x1080 screen but
            elements become shifted around and end up in weird places on any
            screens outside that resolution. This one could easily be cleaned up
            with some Bootstrap work.

            This group API project was my first major experience coding in a
            team environment. Working collaboratively was awesome, since I got
            to see how other people write their code and how different minds can
            come up with different solutions to the same problem. Our group was
            very supportive and helpful to each other throughout the project,
            and even when the GitHub branches got wonky just a few days before
            the due date, and the only working copy was on one of our local
            machines, we kept our cool and were able to finish strong and turn
            in a fully functional project that met many of its stretch goals.

            I'm still proud of this project, and I'm definitely grateful for the
            Git lessons it taught me. Working on a team of devs is a far
            different experience than just coding by oneself, and figuring out
            how to integrate 3 separate styles and files into a cohesive unit
            was incredibly satisfying.

            The final boss of Eleven Fifty - the individual MVC application. The
            challenge was to build a fully fleshed-out back end and customized
            front end using the MVC structure. I chose to build a repository for
            video games, with information about the developer, the platform,
            release date, genre, ESRB rating, and more. All columns in the list
            views are fully linked to view other lists filtered by the
            respective column, and the detail views for each game, developer,
            and platform are fully linked as well. One of my stretch goals was
            to implement user-specific collections for games the user has
            played, games they own, and games they want to own, but while
            attempting to implement the functionality I realized I was in over
            my head and was lost in a sea of debugging just 4 days before the
            due date. Thus, the finished product linked here is the result of 1
            day of back-end coding, 1 day of back-end debugging, and 1 day of
            Razor/CSS front-end implementation.
          </p>
          <p class="img-description">
            Once again, due to the rush of trying to rewrite the whole project,
            I did not have the time to implement the Bootstrap functionality
            that would have made the site so much cleaner and more
            professional-looking. When I entered into the &quot;Software
            Development&quot; program, I was not expecting to work with anything
            front-end at all; in fact, I was averse to learning it because I
            wanted to perfect the back-end first. Now having worked in a
            full-stack role, I wish that I would have learned basic front-end

            I am currently working freelance on this project for a local K-pop
            community back in Indianapolis. I joined the group as a social media
            admin for Instagram, but offered to take over as a web dev for them,
            as currently they are running a Squarespace site and using Google
            Forms/Docs to manage all of their data.

            This project is great because I have been experimenting with
            building out the site in different languages/frameworks. I started
            in ASP.NET Core, but wanted something a bit more lightweight so I
            changed over to Node.js/Express, which I was already relatively
            familiar with from my job. However, I am a perpetual autodidact, and
            so I have restarted again - this time using
            <span class="nope"
              >Nx/React. Other technologies that I will be learning & improving
              in for this project include Docker, Nx Cloud, and ensuring test
              coverage using Jest and Cypress.</span
            >
            Actually, I've restarted once more, using a less boilerplate
            approach of just raw Node.js for the server side and React.js for
            the client side, PostgreSQL for the database, and
            Docker/Nginx/Kubernetes to containerize and host the site. I will
            also be exploring remote hosting options so that I don't have to use
            my local machine's resources for the production site (for several
            reasons).
