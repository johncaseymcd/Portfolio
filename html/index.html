          <p class="body-text">
            I'm 28 years old and I've been coding with a career in mind since
            October 2020, but I've wanted to be a programmer since I was 12. To
            that end, I took several classes in high school and college -
            covering languages like C++, Java, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JS.
            <br />
            My junior year of high school proved to be a major turning point in
            my career aspirations, however, as I failed out of my AP Java
            Programming course and took a huge blow to my confidence. Upon
            entering college, I decided to abandon my dreams and declare a major
            in Economics.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            After 6 years of college, I decided mid-semester in my senior
            capstone course that Econ really just wasn't my thing. I left school
            to go to work full time at a data entry position for a financial
            services company, but I quickly found myself wanting more. I took a
            promotion at that company to a client-facing role, but that wasn't
            fulfilling me either - and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            A coworker from that company had gone through a coding bootcamp to
            learn web development, and she mentioned that they were offering
            free tuition as part of the CARES Act, so with nothing to lose I
            decided to rekindle my interest in coding. I signed up for the
            software development course, where I learned the essentials of C#,
            specifically the ASP.NET Framework for building web APIs and MVC
            structures in a code-first model.
            <br />
            I fell in love with the logic, the processes, and the syntax, and
            everything finally clicked in a way that it hadn't when I was in
            high school. Shortly after I graduated from the bootcamp, I was
            brought on as an assistant instructor, responsible for helping
            students not only debug their code, but understand <i>how</i> to
            debug and <i>why</i> the solutions were correct. Knowledge without
            context is only useful for bar trivia, so it's important for me to
            figure out the reasoning behind an answer - and I loved being able
            to help other people reach those &quot;A-HA&quot; moments.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            As someone who has held jobs in a wide array of fields, ranging from
            food service to financial service, writing code for a living has
            been the most challenging yet rewarding experience of my working
            life, and I would love to keep doing it for years to come.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            Maybe I will spend some of those years working with you?

        <div class="col-md-6 invisible" id="tldr">
          <h1 class="section-header">The TL;DR</h1>

          <p class="body-text">
            I've been coding as a career path for 2 years, starting off as a
            bootcamp student learning API and MVC architectures in the C#
            ASP.NET Framework. After graduating, I was hired as a part of the
            instructor staff at that bootcamp, helping students who were . From
            there, I moved to a small startup, where I learned how to build and
            deploy full stack web projects in an Amazon Web Services cloud
            environment, using Node.js.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            Prior to learning code, I was always interested in tech but never
            committed enough to make a living off of it, so I spent my working
            life in various positions, from food service and retail to mortgage
            and escrow. Nothing seemed to stick, so I eventually decided to do
            what I had actually wanted to do since I was in middle school, and
            now I have a vision for the future of my career.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">Maybe you will be a part of that future?</p>

          /></a>
          <p class="img-description">
            The CSS Creature was a challenge to design a face using only CSS to style HTML &lt;div&gt; tags. I created a triangular creature loosely based on Katy Kat from Parappa The Rapper and Frylock from Aqua Teen Hunger Force, using an outrun/synthwave aesthetic and color scheme (my favorite color palette, if you couldn't tell...)
          </p>
          <p class="img-description">
            Looking back on this project now, and even in the thumbnail for this gallery entry, I see how little I knew about responsive design when I was first starting out. The face is off-center on the circle, and completely outside of the cirle on screens that are larger/smaller than 1920x1080 - the resolution of the monitor I was using at the time. Now that I have done more full-stack projects, I have begun to see the beauty of Bootstrap and mobile-first design patterns for front-end work.

          <p class = "img-description">
            The static store front project was an exercise in HTML and CSS. For this project, I created a mockup of a record store website, featuring sections for new music releases, nearby concerts, and a Spotify iframe to showcase recent listening.
          </p>
          <p class="img-description">
            While I think the site turned out pretty well for just being raw HTML &amp; CSS, this project also suffers from a lack of responsiveness. Again, it looks okay on a 1920x1080 screen but elements become shifted around and end up in weird places on any screens outside that resolution. This one could easily be cleaned up with some Bootstrap work.
